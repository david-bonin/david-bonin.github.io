## Summary
‘’An essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency developed in a 19-year-old man who was being maintained on a long-term regimen of fat-free, intravenous, hyperalimentation fluids. The EFA deficiency was reversed after 21 days by daily, topical application of linoleic acid to the patient’s skin. The ratio of elcostatrienoic acid (20:3, n-9) to elcosatetraeonic acid (20:4, n-6) decreased to normal levels in the skin and serum with clinical improvement on the EFA deficiency syndrome. The cutaneous manifestations (scalp dermatitis, alopecia, and depigmentation of hair) were reversed with continued, topical application of safflower oil, which contains 60% to 70% linoleic acid. 

### Quotes

> Rats, dogs, mice, and pigs that were fed EFA-deficient diets developed eczema, dry, scaling skin, tail necrosis, renal edema, and sterility.  

Their reference for this is:

I wonder if this is referring to the Burr’s experiments? Probably.

### A 19 y. old patient with inflammatory bowel disease

Regrowth and repigmentation of his scalp and eyebrow hair 
occurred after three months of topical therapy using safflower oil (60-70% linoleic acid)

Of particular interest in this study is the repigmentation and growth of 
new scalp and eyebrow hair by the patient after several months of daily topical treatment with safflower oil.

Maybe related to the lard-hair growth study
